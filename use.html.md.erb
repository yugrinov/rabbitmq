This topic provides instructions for developers on how to use the on-demand <%= vars.product_full %>
service for their apps that run on <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.
<%= vars.product_short %> enables messaging between cloud-based servers, apps, and devices.

These procedures use the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI).
You can also use [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html)
to perform the same tasks using a graphical UI.

For general information, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites



## <a id="resilient-apps"></a> Create Resilient Apps

Resilient apps are less likely to crash during downtime, such as when upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>.
For how to create resilient apps, see the [workloads](https://github.com/rabbitmq/workloads/tree/master/resiliency#resilient-applications-in-java-handle-connection-failures-and-more)
repository in GitHub.

## <a id='marketplace'></a>Confirm Service Availability

For an app to use a service, the service must be available in the Marketplace for its space.

To confirm this availability:

1. List the services that are available in the Marketplace:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```
1. Verify that `p.rabbitmq` is in the `service` column. If it is, on-demand <%= vars.product_short %> is available. If it is not, ask your operator to install it.
<br><br>
For example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
service      plans         description
[...]
p.rabbitmq   single-node   RabbitMQ service to provide dedicated instances of this high-performance multi-protocol messaging broker
[...]
</pre>

## <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

For an app to use a service, an instance of the service must exist in its space.
On-Demand services are created asynchronously, not immediately.
The `watch` command shows you when your service instance is ready to bind and use.

You can enable TLS and additional plugins using the `cf create-service` command.
For instructions on how to modify the `cf create-service` command,
see [Enable TLS for Your Service Instance](#tls) or [Enable Optional Plugins](#optional-plugins) below.

To create an instance of the on-demand <%= vars.product_short %> service:

1. See if there is an existing service by running:

    ```
    cf services
    ```
    Look for instances that have `p.rabbitmq` in the `service` column.
    If there is an existing instance that you want to use, skip to the [Bind a Service Instance to Your App](#bind) section below.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service      plan                   bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.rabbitmq   single-node, plan-2                  create succeeded
    </pre>

1. Create the service instance by running:

    ```
    cf create-service p.rabbitmq SINGLE-NODE SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    + `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is a name you choose to identify the service instance.
    This name appears under `name` in the output from `cf services`.
    + `SINGLE-NODE` is the plan.
    You can replace it with any of the other plans listed in the Marketplace for the
    `p.rabbitmq` service.

1. Verify that the process was successful by running:

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```

    If successful, `last operation` for your instance is reported as `create succeeded`.<br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ cf create-service p.rabbitmq single-node my-instance<br>
       Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
       OK<br>
      $ watch cf services<br>
       Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
       OK
       name          service        plan           bound apps    last operation
       my-instance   p.rabbitmq     single-node                  create succeeded
    </pre>

   If you encounter an error, see [Troubleshooting Instances](./troubleshoot-instances.html).

## <a id="using-tls"></a> Use Transport Layer Security (TLS)

The operator must enable TLS in the **Security for On-Demand Plans** tab before you can use this feature.
For more information, see [Configure Security](./install-config.html#security).

To use TLS to secure communication between your app and a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance:

1. [Enable TLS for Your Service Instance](#tls)
1. If your app is written in Java or Spring, follow the steps in the
[Activate TLS for Java and Spring Apps](#tls-java-spring) section below.
If it is not, follow the steps in [Modifying Apps for TLS](./modify-apps-tls.html).


### <a id='tls'></a>Enable TLS for Your Service Instance

If the operator has configured TLS to be optional, then follow the steps below to enable TLS on a service instance.
If the operator has configured TLS to be enforced, then all service instances have TLS enabled and it is not necessary to follow the steps below.
For more information, see [Configure Security](./install-config.html#security).

To configure TLS for your service instance:

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you enable TLS for a service instance, you can no longer connect to it without using TLS.
</p>

1. Enable TLS by doing one of the following steps:
  * If you have already created a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance, update the service instance to use TLS by running:

        ```
        cf update-service MY-INSTANCE -c '{"tls": true}'
        ```
        Where `MY-INSTANCE` is the name you chose when you created your service instance.<br><br>
  * If you have not created a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance, create one with TLS enabled by running:

        ```
        cf create-service p.rabbitmq PLAN MY-INSTANCE -c '{"tls": true}'
        ```

        Where:<br>
          * `PLAN` is the name of the deployment plan to use for this service instance
          * `MY-INSTANCE` is the name to give to the new service instance

1. Verify that the process was successful by running:

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```
    If successful, the <code>last operation</code> for your instance is reported as
    `create succeeded` or `update succeeded`.<br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
      $ watch cf services<br>
       Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
       OK
       name          service        plan           bound apps    last operation
       my-instance   p.rabbitmq     single-node                  create succeeded
    </pre>

### <a id="tls-turn-off"></a> Disable TLS for Your Service Instance

If the operator has configured TLS to be enforced, then all service instances have TLS enabled and it is not possible to disable TLS.
If the operator has configured TLS to be optional or not configured, then follow the steps below to disable TLS on a service instance.
For more information, see [Configure Security](./install-config.html#security).

1. Disable TLS by doing one of the following:
  * If you have already created a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance, update the service instance by running:

        ```
        cf update-service MY-INSTANCE -c '{"tls": false}'
        ```
        Where `MY-INSTANCE` is the name you chose when you created your service instance.<br><br>
  * If you have not created a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance,
  request a service instance with TLS disabled by running:

        ```
        cf create-service p.rabbitmq PLAN MY-INSTANCE -c '{"tls": false}'
        ```

        Where:<br>
          * `PLAN` is the name of the deployment plan to use for this service instance
          * `MY-INSTANCE` is the name to give to the new service instance

1. Verify that the process was successful by running:

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```
    If successful, the last operation for your instance is reported as
    `update succeeded`.<br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
      $ watch cf services<br>
       Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
       OK
       name          service        plan           bound apps    last operation
       my-instance   p.rabbitmq     single-node                  update succeeded
    </pre>

### <a id="tls-java-spring"></a> Activate TLS for Java and Spring Apps

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If your app is not written in Java or Spring, see <a href="./modify-apps-tls.html"> Modifying Apps for TLS</a>.
</p>


For an app to use TLS, you must update it to request encrypted communications when connecting to a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance.
The procedure for updating your app depends on the app's language and framework. Java and Spring apps automatically detect TLS.

To activate TLS for Java and Spring apps, do one of the following:

* For apps that are not bound to an existing service instance, re-push the apps by running
the `cf push` command.

* For apps bound to an existing service instance, re-bind the apps as follows:
  1. Stop the app:

        ```
        cf stop APP-NAME
        ```
  1. Unbind the app from the service instance:

        ```
        cf unbind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
        ```
  1. Re-bind the app to the service instance:

        ```
        cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
        ```
  1. Restart the app.

        ```
        cf restart APP-NAME
        ```

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If the operator used a self-signed certificate,
  configure your app to use the same CA certificate and valid certificate and key.
</p>


## <a id="optional-plugins"></a> Enable Optional Plugins

For a list of RabbitMQ plugins that are enabled or disabled by default in
on-demand <%= vars.product_short %> instances, see
[RabbitMQ Server Plugins](./install-config.html#server-plugins).

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If a plugin is disabled by default,
  the operator must enable the plugin for the platform before you can enable it on your service instances.
  For more information, see <a href="./install-config.html#optional-plugins">Enable Extra RabbitMQ Server Plugins</a>.
</p>

You can enable plugins when you create a service instance or by updating an existing
service instance. When enabling more than one plugin, specify all the plugin names in the same command.

To enable plugins, run one of these commands, specifying the plugins
as a configuration parameter in JSON:

* When creating a service instance, run:

    ```
    cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c PARAMETER-AS-JSON
    ```

    Where the `PARAMETER-AS-JSON` key is the plugin and the value is `true`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service p.rabbitmq single-node myservice -c '{ "plugins": { "rabbitmq_event_exchange": true } }'
    </pre>
    For example, when enabling more than one plugin:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service p.rabbitmq single-node myservice -c '{ "plugins": { "rabbitmq_event_exchange": true, "rabbitmq_mqtt": true } }'
    </pre>

* When updating an existing service instance, run:

    ```
    cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c PARAMETER-AS-JSON
    ```

    Where the `PARAMETER-AS-JSON` key is the plugin and the value is `true`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service myservice -c '{ "plugins": { "rabbitmq_event_exchange": true } }'
    </pre>
    For example, when enabling more than one plugin:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service myservice -c '{ "plugins": { "rabbitmq_amqp1_0": true, "rabbitmq_event_exchange": true } }'
    </pre>


## <a id="disable-plugins"></a> Disable Optional Plugins

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> When creating a service instance, optional plugins are disabled by default.
</p>

To disable plugins for an existing service instance:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c PARAMETER-AS-JSON
    ```

    Where the `PARAMETER-AS-JSON` key is the plugin and the value is `false`.<br><br>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service myservice -c '{ "plugins": { "rabbitmq_event_exchange": false}}'
    </pre>
    For example, when disabling more than one plugin:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service myservice -c '{ "plugins": { "rabbitmq_amqp1_0": false, "rabbitmq_event_exchange": false } }'
    </pre>


## <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind it to a service instance.
Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    - `APP-NAME` is the app you want to use the <%= vars.product_short %> service instance.
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Binding service mydb to my-app in org my-org / space test as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

## <a id="call"></a>Use the RabbitMQ Service in Your App

Apps running in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> gain access to the bound service instances through
an environment variable credentials hash called `VCAP_SERVICES`.
An example hash is shown below:

<pre>

      ]
    }
  }]
}
</pre>

Apps that have been bound to a service instance can read `VCAP_SERVICES` from their environment.
To see the `VCAP_SERVICES` for an app, run `cf env APP-NAME` with the name of an app bound to the <%= vars.product_short %> instance.

For more information about the environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES`, see [RabbitMQ Environment Variables](./reference.html).

## <a id="bosh-dns"></a>RabbitMQ Node Address Resolution

The `hostnames` field in `VCAP_SERVICES` contains a single hostname,
even if there is more than one RabbitMQ node.
BOSH DNS resolves the hostname to a list of the IP addresses of all the available RabbitMQ nodes.
The order of the IP addresses rotates so that there is load balancing.

A RabbitMQ client can use the first IP address returned.
If a node becomes unavailable, BOSH DNS removes it from the list of resolved IP addresses.
Because of this, apps should not cache the IP addresses of the nodes, as the cache might become outdated.
The Java buildpack automatically disables DNS caching.


## <a id="single"></a> Upgrade an Individual Service Instance



## <a id="restart"></a>Update a Service Instance

If you bind a new service or change the service bindings, you need to run
`cf restart` to update the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable in the application container.

To restart your app:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf restart-app APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the app you want to use the updated service instance.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf restart my-app
    </pre>

Pushing the new version of an app automatically restages and restarts the app on
any service instances it is bound to.

## <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind a Service Instance From Your App

To stop an app from using a service it no longer needs, unbind it from the service instance.


To unbind a service instance from your app:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf unbind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    - `APP-NAME` is the app you want to stop using the <%= vars.product_short %> service instance.
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot delete a service instance that an app is bound to.
</p>

To delete a service instance:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-service my-instance<br>
    Are you sure you want to delete the service my-instance ? y
    Deleting service my-service in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

1. Verify that the service instance was deleted by running:

    ```
    watch cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    and then wait for a `Service instance not found` error indicating that the instance no longer exists.


## <a id="admin"></a> Create an Admin User for a Service Instance

If you want admin privileges for the RabbitMQ Management UI, you can create
an admin user for a service instance and obtain user credentials that you can
share with other app developers.

Both operators and app developers can use this procedure.
For instructions, see [Create an Admin User for a Service Instance](./install-config.html#admin-service-key).

## <a id="share-instances"></a> Share Service Instances
To share service instances, your operator must enable the feature flag `service_instance_sharing`.
You can then follow the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html)
to share your service instances across Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces.

## <a id="federation"></a> Federate Exchanges and Queues

You can federate exchanges and queues in <%= vars.product_short %>, just like in any other RabbitMQ deployment.

To federate exchanges and queues:

1. Create a service key by following the instructions in [Create an Admin User for a Service Instance](./install-config.html#admin-service-key). The output of the above procedure returns admin user credentials, along with other data.

1. In the output from the above step, look for the `uris` array. It has the following pattern<br>
<pre class="terminal">
{
  ...
  "uri": "amqp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@DNS\_ENTRY/VHOST",
  "uris": [
    "amqp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@DNS\_ENTRY/VHOST"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
as seen in the below example.<br>
<pre class="terminal">
{
...
"uri": "amqp://b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f:passwordexample123456789<span>@</span>q-s0.rabbitmq-server.services-subnet.service-instance-e0e7fc5f-c1c7-4211-81b9-284fb29ba851.bosh:5672/62e5ab21-7b38-44ac-b139-6aa97af01cd7",
"uris": [
"amqp://b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f:passwordexample123456789<span>@</span>q-s0.rabbitmq-server.services-subnet.service-instance-e0e7fc5f-c1c7-4211-81b9-284fb29ba851.bosh:5672/62e5ab21-7b38-44ac-b139-6aa97af01cd7",
...
}
</pre>


1. Set up federation as usual, using the RabbitMQ Management UI or API, with the URIs found in the `uris` array you got from the step above.<br><br>
    For instructions on federation, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html).

## <a id="shovel"></a> Shovel Exchanges and Queues

You can shovel exchanges and queues in <%= vars.product_short %>, just like in any other RabbitMQ deployment.

To shovel exchanges and queues:

1. Create a service key by following the instructions in [Create an Admin User for a Service Instance](./install-config.html#admin-service-key). The output of the above procedure returns admin user credentials, along with other data.

1. In the output from the above step, look for the `uris` array. It has the following pattern<br>
<pre class="terminal">
{
  ...
  "uri": "amqp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@DNS\_ENTRY/VHOST",
  "uris": [
    "amqp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@DNS\_ENTRY/VHOST"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
as seen in the example below.<br>
<pre class="terminal">
